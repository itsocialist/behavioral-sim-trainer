# Lean Canvas: Behavioral Simulation Training Platform

**Date:** December 24, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Problem

**Top 3 Problems:**

1. **Limited Realistic Practice** - Current crisis intervention and substance abuse training relies on static content and limited role-play. Trainees lack safe, realistic environments to practice recognition skills.

2. **High Cost & Scalability Issues** - 40-hour CIT training costs $5K+ per cohort in instructor time. Difficult to provide ongoing practice and skill maintenance between formal sessions.

3. **Cannot Simulate Dangerous Behaviors** - No safe way to simulate intoxicated/crisis behaviors for training without ethical/legal concerns.

**Existing Alternatives:**
- In-person role-play (CIT programs)
- Static e-learning ($50-400/seat)
- VR use-of-force training (doesn't address behavioral recognition)

---

## Key Assumptions to Test

**Riskiest Assumptions:**

1. **AI Quality Assumption:** AI can realistically simulate behavioral crises well enough to provide training value
   - **Test:** Build prototype, get expert validation, measure learning outcomes

2. **Skills Transfer Assumption:** Training in simulation transfers to real-world performance
   - **Test:** Pre/post field assessments, measure real-world incident outcomes

3. **Pricing Assumption:** Customers will pay premium vs. e-learning for better quality
   - **Test:** Pilot pricing experiments, measure willingness to pay

4. **Sales Cycle Assumption:** Can sell to government in <6 months
   - **Test:** Track actual sales cycles, identify bottlenecks

5. **Adoption Assumption:** Users will engage regularly (not one-and-done)
   - **Test:** Track DAU/MAU, session frequency in pilot programs

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| AI simulation quality insufficient | HIGH | Expert validation, safety guardrails, continuous refinement |
| Slow government sales cycles | HIGH | Grant support, pilot programs, Q3/Q4 timing |
| Anthropic API reliability | MEDIUM | Fallback strategies, caching, direct relationship |
| Competition from incumbents | MEDIUM | Speed to market, partnerships, superior UX |
| Limited skills transfer | MEDIUM | Academic validation studies, field assessments |
