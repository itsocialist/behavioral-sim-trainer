## 🎯 Product Overview

**Name:** SimuTrain (working title)  
**Category:** AI-Powered Training Platform  
**Mission:** Enable safe, realistic practice for recognizing behavioral health crises

### The Problem
- Current crisis training relies on expensive role-play ($5K+ per cohort) or static e-learning
- Cannot safely simulate intoxicated/crisis behaviors
- No ongoing practice opportunities
- 25% of police shootings involve mental illness; 65% of workplace accidents involve substance use

### The Solution
AI-powered simulations providing unlimited, realistic conversations with individuals experiencing:
- Substance intoxication (alcohol, stimulants, opioids)
- Mental health crises (psychosis, mania, depression, anxiety)
- Medical emergencies (overdose, delirium)
